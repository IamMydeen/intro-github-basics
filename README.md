Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
You have to first create your repository and then give it a description
Secondly, you then initialize the git and then make all your necessary changes on the file you want to change
you then use the command "git commit -m "commit message" to commit your changes
Then you use git push to push your changes to the remote repository
